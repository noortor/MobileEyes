We are living in a crucial point in time, where more people than ever are organizing to overturn old structures and establish new ones that secure social, environmental and economic justice. We need our technology to meet the moment, allowing activists to spread the word and assemble for change while protecting them from surveillance and threats to their privacy. Introducing MobileEyes, a mobile app powered by the Flutter framework.

MobileEyes makes it easy to discover upcoming protests, rallies, or activism events—known simply as "Springs" within the app. Users can see where and when nearby Springs will begin and learn about their missions and background. On the day of the event, when users arrive at the listed location, the app will allow them to "Check In", which adds a flower to the Spring's visual garden. As more and more activists assemble, the Spring thrives, which encourages even more people to join in and grow the movement. Those wanting to create events themselves can use MobileEyes to "Seed a Spring" in just a few taps. After filling out information about the Spring, they can plant the seeds for a brand new movement. Users can also view Springs they've shown interest in, attended, or created in the past with a quick calendar view. 

**With options to create, browse, and join grassroots movements and even more features on the horizon, we'll watch activism bloom with MobileEyes.**
